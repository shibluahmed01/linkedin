<h1> Linkedin </h1>
I developed a responsive web application that serves as a clone of LinkedIn using Vue.js The app includes secure login and logout functionality through Google Firebase.

To ensure optimal UI design, I utilized CSS3 grid, flexbox, transform, and BEM convention. The resulting app is fully responsive and provides an enjoyable visual experience on both wide screens and smaller devices.
